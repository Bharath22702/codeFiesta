# codeFiesta

This Project is for CodeFiesta Hackathon.

The code converts a pdf to .txt form first and then converts .txt to .json form.

To run the program make sure PyPDF2, googletrans are installed.

First copy the pdf to be parsed to the same folder as these files.
Make sure the copy is translated through google translate.

Then Run the py2txt.py
This extracts the words from each page of the pdf.
Then run the txt2json.py, this converts the text file to required json format.
